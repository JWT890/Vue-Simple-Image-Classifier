# simple-image-classifier

A project that I did at SAIC to display my learning of Vue to make a super simple AI image classifier. Based off a 50/50 split, it will determine if a picture containing a dog or cat is in fact a dog or cat. The program runs by having a json file containing two labels of cat and dog. This is further determined by a Math.random() function that splits a 50/50 decision between the picture and classifies it either way. You can use a picture off the Internet or use your own dog/cat pictures for this one. 

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
